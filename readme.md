## Overview

This is my first attempt of getting out of tutorial hell and making a javascript project, a simple, minimal daily task manager.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create a list of daily tasks
- Interact with their list of tasks by checking them off and deleting them

## My process

This is my first try of writing Javascript inside my own IDE. I was pretty intimidated and needed a ton of help from the internet, but I was able to style it in the minimal way that I envisioned. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned that taking a course on Javascript and writing Javascript is very different. I felt like I didn't know anything when I got started, but slowing taking it one step at a time, watching some videos and reading, I was able to use the principles in other code to write this. I know a dev's strong suit is researching well and trying not to copy someone's code without giving credit, and I feel like this is slow step in that direction.

Oh yeah, DOM Manipulation too...    

### Continued development

More projects, more Javascript.
